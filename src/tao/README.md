# TAO for Conduit

Converting a Conduit App to use the TAO, we want to iterate and specify the
Product Requirements by converting Conduit's Domain Model to the descriptive
TAO dialect

You can find the resources here:

* [Trigrams](TRIGRAMS.md) - lists the `Term`s, `Action`s and `Orientation`s from the Domain Model
* [Paths](PATHS.md) - translates teh Use Cases of the application to a series of TAO Paths
